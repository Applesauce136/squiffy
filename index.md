Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive fiction.

The Squiffy compiler reads in a Squiffy script file, and outputs HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A player's game state is saved automatically to Local Storage.

Publishing your game
--------------------

Squiffy creates HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, which you can upload anywhere. You don't need to distribute your source .squiffy file - everything that is needed for the game to run is contained in the HTML and JavaScript.

An easy way to distribute your game is to create a ZIP file and [submit it to textadventures.co.uk](http://textadventures.co.uk/create/submit).
