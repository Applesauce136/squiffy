Set a start value: [[1]](one) or [[2]](two).

[[one]]:
@set my_attribute=1

Maybe you'd like it to be [3](three) instead? Or you could just [[continue...]](next)

[three]:
@set my_attribute=3

OK. Three it is.

[[two]]:
@set my_attribute=2

Maybe you'd like it to be [4](four) instead? Or you could just [[continue...]](next)

[four]:
@set my_attribute=4

OK. Four it is.

[[next]]:
my_attribute = {my_attribute}
