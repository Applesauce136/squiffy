Squiffy
=======

Squiffy is a tool for creating multiple choice interactive fiction. Squiffy is written entirely in JavaScript - the compiler uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the games it generates run in a web browser.

For installation and usage instructions, [see the documentation](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/).

The plans for forthcoming releases are on the [development roadmap](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/roadmap.html).

For discussion and help, see [the forums](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=24).
