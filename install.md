title: Installing Squiffy
---

As an alternative to the [web version](http://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/editor), Squiffy is also available as a command-line Node package. This runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

To install Squiffy, first [install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Next, install the [squiffy package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/squiffy) from npm, by typing this into a Command Prompt or Terminal:

    npm install squiffy -g

The `-g` option installs Squiffy globally, so you can easily run it from any directory.

**If the install fails:** On a Mac or Linux, if you get an error installing Squiffy, try using `sudo`:

	sudo npm install squiffy -g
