The Squiffy compiler is written in Python, and has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3. It requires the [Markdown package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown).

Detailed step-by-step instructions for Windows and Mac OS X are below.

Windows
-------

First, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Either Python 2 or Python 3 should work.

Next, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) (not necessary if you installed Python 3).

Install the [Markdown package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) by typing this at a command prompt:

	pip install markdown

Finally, [download Squiffy](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy/archive/master.zip) and unzip it somewhere.

Mac OS X
--------

Python is already installed on your machine, as it's part of OS X.

First, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).
