title: Installing Squiffy
---

The Squiffy compiler is written in Python, and has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3. It requires the [Markdown package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown).

Detailed step-by-step instructions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are below.

Windows
-------

First, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Either Python 2 or Python 3 should work.

Next, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) (not necessary if you installed Python 3).

Install the [Markdown package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) by typing this at a command prompt:

	pip install markdown

Finally, [download Squiffy](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy/releases/download/v1.0/squiffy-1.0.zip) and unzip it somewhere.

Mac OS X and Linux
------------------

Python is already installed on your machine (it's preinstalled on OS X, and most Linux distributions).

First, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

Install the [Markdown package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) by typing this in a Terminal window:

	sudo pip install markdown

Finally, [download Squiffy](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy/releases/download/v1.0/squiffy-1.0.zip) and unzip it somewhere.
